# A.I-Assistant


    Created an AI voice assistant similar to Google assistant solely using python.

    It can do pretty much everything a google assistant can do like searching upon receiving voice commands by the user.

    We have added some extra features in it like it can shut down the computer if you command it for the same.

How to use it

    Upon execution of the program, you just need to leave it and continue with your work while it keeps running in the background seeking for a wake-up keyword.

    It works on two keywords ,'Ok google' and 'hey google' to trigger the assistant, following the commands that you want it do for you similar to Goggle assistant.

Some of the packages included to built are:

    pyttsx3

    pywhatkit

    SpeachRecognition

    pyjokes

    webbrowser

    datetime etc.

Technical requirements:

    Os- Windows 7, 10

    Proper internet connection

    Python3 installed along with the mentioned packages

    Inbuilt or external mic for receiving commands
